An C# based client library for **EBICS H004** and **EBICS H005**.

The Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard (EBICS) is a German transmission protocol developed by the German Banking Industry Committee for sending payment information between banks over the Internet. It grew out of the earlier BCS-FTAM protocol that was developed in 1995, with the aim of being able to use internet connections and TCP/IP. It is mandated for use by German banks and has also been adopted by France and Switzerland. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Banking_Internet_Communication_Standard).

This client library supports all four APIs, HBCI 2.2, FinTS 3.0 and EBICS H004 and H005.

It can be used to read the balance of a bank account, receive an account statement, and make a SEPA payment using **PIN/TAN** and **EBICS**.
